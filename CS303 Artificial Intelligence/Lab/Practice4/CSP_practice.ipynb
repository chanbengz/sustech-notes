    "In the following code, only two of the function usages are essential. One is `is_valid(self, state)`, which checks if the current state is legal; the other is `is_satisfy(self, state)`, which is to checks if the current board meets the win condition. \n",
    "The type of state is [], which stores the tuples(a, b), representing the positions of the queens in it.\n",

    "In test block, for `Solver`,  `n` indicates the size of the test while `method` indicates which bts function will be used(`bts` or `improving_bts`or`min_conflict`); for method `solve`, `render` indicates whether to use a graphical interface representation.\n",

    "## Question 1: You should complete the function `bts()`. (0.8 points)\n",
    "You can only use iterative way, not recursive. Using recursion will incur a **20% penalty**. You may add any function you want. \n",
